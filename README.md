An introduction to JavaScript at a Google Developer Group [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/GDGOslo/events/103477952/).

Tine Kleivane - "Before frameworks: JavaScript basics"

JavaScript is emerging as a major trend, but a lot of developers follow a copy-paste technique when learning and using the language. This presentation covers the basics of JavaScript, from variables and functions to inheritance and classes. We will also see how its asynchronous execution affects us and how we can handle it.

Tine is a developer at Bekk Consulting and is currently working on Java and JavaScript projects. She has a keen interest in JavaScript and fights to keep the spaghetti code at bay. This can and have been done in multiple ways and with a myriad of frameworks, but with the continuous innovation in the JS world there is still much to embrace.
